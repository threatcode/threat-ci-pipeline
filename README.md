# Debian pipeline for Developers

Build and test on reproducible environments on every push.

TL;DR: Use this CI/CD configuration file setting:

```
recipes/debian.yml@salsa-ci-team/pipeline
```

## Introduction

The Salsa CI Team work aims to improve the Debian packaging lifecycle by providing [Continuous Integration](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/) fully compatible with Debian packaging.

Currently all the building and testing performed by Debian QA is run asynchronously and takes a long time to give feedback because it is only accessible after pushing a release to the archive.

Our [pipeline](https://salsa.debian.org/help/ci/pipelines/index.md) definition is focused on speeding up this process by giving developers faster feedback.

## What does this _pipeline_ provide for my project/package?

The [pipeline](https://salsa.debian.org/help/ci/pipelines/index.md) builds your package(s) and runs multiple checks on them after every push to Salsa.

This provides you with instant feedback about any problems the changes you made may have created or solved, without the need to do a push to the archive, speeding up your development cycle and improving the quality of packages uploaded to Debian.

While the pipeline is a Work-In-Progress project, it will always try to replicate the tests run by Debian QA.
The services we got working are the following:

 * Building the package from the source (only gbp is supported)
 * [Lintian](https://lintian.debian.org)
 * Reproducible build using [Reprotest](https://reproducible-builds.org/tools)
 * [Piuparts](https://piuparts.debian.org)
 * [Autopkgtest](https://salsa.debian.org/ci-team/autopkgtest/raw/master/doc/README.package-tests.rst)
 * [Buildd Log Scanner](https://qa.debian.org/bls/)

Those services are enabled by something we called `salsa-pipeline` and it will be shared for all Salsa projects who adopt it.
Having this on GitLab CI ensures that every package accomplishes the minimum quality to be in the archive and if we improve or add a new service the project will get the benefit instantaneously.

## Basic Use

To use the Salsa Pipeline, the first thing to do is to enable the project's Pipeline. Go to `Settings` (General), expand `Visibility, project features, permissions`, and in `Repository`, enable `CI/CD`. This makes the `CI/CD` settings and menu available.
Then, change the project's setting to make it point to the pipeline's config file.
This can be done on `Settings` -> `CI/CD` (on the expanded menu, don't click on the CI / CD rocket) -> `General Pipelines` -> `CI/CD configuration file`.

If the base pipeline configuration fits your needs without further modifications, the recommended way is to use `recipes/debian.yml@salsa-ci-team/pipeline` as config path, which refers to a file kept in the salsa-ci-team/pipeline repository.

On the other hand, if you want to use the base configuration and apply customizations on top, the recommended path to create this file is `debian/salsa-ci.yml`.
It should contain at least the following lines:

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/recipes/debian.yml
```

> :warning: **Note:** On Debian projects, you would normally want to put this file under the `debian/` folder.

## Advanced Use

Following the basic instructions will allow you to add all the building and testing stages as provided by the salsa-ci-team.
However, customization of the scripts is possible.

The [`salsa-ci.yml`](https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/blob/master/salsa-ci.yml) template delivers the jobs definitions.
Including only this file, no job will be added to the pipeline.
On the other hand, [`pipeline-jobs.yml`](https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/blob/master/pipeline-jobs.yml) includes all the jobs' instances.

### Changing the Debian Release

By default, everything will run on the `'unstable'` suite.
Changing the release is as easy as setting a `RELEASE` variable.

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

variables:
  RELEASE: 'buster'
```

The following releases are currently supported:
* stretch
* stretch-backports
* buster
* buster-backports
* bullseye
* bullseye-backports
* stable
* testing
* unstable
* experimental

### Avoid running CI on certain branches

It is possible to configure the pipeline to skip branches you don't want CI to be run on.
The `SALSA_CI_IGNORED_BRANCHES` variable can be set to a regex that will be compared against the ref name and will decide if a pipeline is created.

By default, pipelines are only created for branches that contain a `debian/` folder.

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

variables:
  SALSA_CI_IGNORED_BRANCHES: 'some-branch|another-ref'
```

### Building with non-free dependencies
By default, only `main` repositories are used.
If your package has dependencies or build-dependencies in the `contrib` or `non-free` components (archive areas), set `SALSA_CI_COMPONENTS` to indicate this:

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

variables:
    RELEASE: 'stretch'
    SALSA_CI_COMPONENTS: 'main contrib non-free'
```

This is currently used for `piuparts`, but is likely to be used for
other stages in future.

It is possible to use the `SALSA_CI_EXTRA_REPOSITORY` support to add a
suitable apt source to the build environment and allow builds to access
build-dependencies from contrib and non-free. You will need permission
to modify the Salsa Settings for the project.

The CI/CD settings are at a URL like:

`https://salsa.debian.org/<team>/<project>/-/settings/ci_cd`
Expand the section on Variables and add a **File** type variable:

> Key: SALSA_CI_EXTRA_REPOSITORY

> Value: deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.debian.org/debian/ sid contrib non-free

The apt source should reference `sid` or `unstable`.

Many `contrib` and `non-free` packages only build on `amd64`, so the
32-bit x86 build (`build i386`) should be disabled. (refer to the [Disabling building on i386](#Disabling-building-on-i386) Section).

### Skipping a job
There are many ways to skip a certain job. The recommended way is to set to `1` (or "`yes`" or "`true`") the `SALSA_CI_DISABLE_*` variables that have been created for this purpose.

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

# This sample disables all default tests, only disable those that you
# don't want
variables:
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_APTLY: 1
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_AUTOPKGTEST: 1
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_BLHC: 1
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_LINTIAN: 1
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_PIUPARTS: 1
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_REPROTEST: 1
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_BUILD_PACKAGE_ALL: 1
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_BUILD_PACKAGE_ANY: 1
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_BUILD_PACKAGE_I386: 1
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_CROSSBUILD_ARM64: 1
```

### Disabling building on i386
The `build i386` job builds packages against the 32-bit x86 architecture. If for any reason you need to skip this job, set the `SALSA_CI_DISABLE_BUILD_PACKAGE_I386` in the variables' block to `1`, '`yes`' or '`true`'.  i.e;

```yaml

variables:
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_BUILD_PACKAGE_I386: 1
```

### Allowing a job to fail
Without completely disabling a job, you can allow it to fail without failing the whole pipeline. That way, if the job fails, the pipeline will pass and show an orange warning telling you something went wrong.

For example, even though reproducible builds are important, `reprotest`'s behavior can sometimes be a little erratic and fail randomly on packages that aren't totally reproducible (yet!). In such case, you can allow `reprotest` to fail by adding this variable in your salsa-ci.yml manifest:

```
include:
 - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
 - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

reprotest:
  allow_failure: true
```

### Set build timeout
At times your job may fail because it reached its max duration (either job timeout, or runner timeout).
In that case, the job would stop immediately without entering the `after_script` phase, and without saving the cache and without saving the artifacts.

To prevent this, the build phase of the build job and the build phase of the reprotest job have a timeout of `2.75h` (the runner's timeout is 3h). This permits also to save the cache of ccache. That way, on the next run, there is more chance to finish the job since it can use ccache's cache.

You can set the `SALSA_CI_BUILD_TIMEOUT_ARGS` variable to override this. The arguments can be any valid argument used by the `timeout` command. For example, you may set:

```
variables:
  SALSA_CI_BUILD_TIMEOUT_ARGS: "0.75h"
```

### Enabling the pipeline for tags
By default, the pipeline is run only for commits, tags are ignored. To run the pipeline against tags as well, export the `SALSA_CI_ENABLE_PIPELINE_ON_TAGS` variable and set it to one of "1", "yes" or "true", like in the following example:

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

variables:
  SALSA_CI_ENABLE_PIPELINE_ON_TAGS: 1
```

### Skipping the whole pipeline on push

There may be reasons to skip the whole pipeline for a `git push`, for example when you are adding `salsa-ci.yml` to hundreds of repositories or doing other mass-changes.

You can achieve this in two ways:

You can insert `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]`, using any capitalization, in the commit message. With this marker, GitLab will not run the pipeline when the commit is pushed.

Alternatively, one can pass the `ci.skip` [Git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt--oltoptiongt) option if using Git 2.10 or newer:

```
git push --push-option=ci.skip    # using git 2.10+
git push -o ci.skip               # using git 2.18+
```

See also https://salsa.debian.org/help/ci/pipelines/index.md#skip-a-pipeline

### Adding your private repositories to the builds

The variables `SALSA_CI_EXTRA_REPOSITORY` and `SALSA_CI_EXTRA_REPOSITORY_KEY` can be
used to add private apt repositories to the sources.list, to be
used by the build and tests, and (optionally) the signing key for the
repositories in armor format. These variables are of
[type file](https://salsa.debian.org/help/ci/variables/index.md#cicd-variable-types),
which ease the multiline handling, but have the disadvantage that they can't
be set on the salsa-ci.yml file.

### Setting variables on pipeline creation

You can set these and other similar variables when launching a new pipeline in different ways:
 * Using the web interface under CI/CD, Run Pipeline, and setting the
desired variables.
 * Using the [GitLab API](https://salsa.debian.org/help/api/index.md). For example,  check the script
[salsa_drive_build.py](https://salsa.debian.org/maxy/qt-kde-ci/blob/tooling/salsa_drive_build.py),
in particular the function
[launch_pipelines](https://salsa.debian.org/maxy/qt-kde-ci/blob/tooling/salsa_drive_build.py#L568).
 * Setting them as part of a pipeline triggered build.

### Only running selected jobs

If you want to use the definitions provided by the Salsa CI Team, but want to explicitly define which jobs to run, you might want to declare your YAML as follows:

```yaml
---
include: https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml

extract-source:
    extends: .provisioning-extract-source

variables:
  RELEASE: 'experimental'

build:
  extends: .build-package

test-build-any:
  extends: .test-build-package-any

test-build-all:
  extends: .test-build-package-all

test-crossbuild-arm64:
  extends: .test-crossbuild-package-arm64

reprotest:
  extends: .test-reprotest

lintian:
  extends: .test-lintian

autopkgtest:
  extends: .test-autopkgtest

blhc:
  extends: .test-blhc

piuparts:
  extends: .test-piuparts

aptly:
  extends: .publish-aptly
```

On the previous example, the package is built on Debian experimental and checked through on all tests currently provided.
You can choose to run only some of the jobs by deleting any of the definitions above.

As new changes are expected to happen from time to time, we **firmly recommend NOT to do define all jobs manually**.
Please consider if [skipping jobs](#skipping-a-job) meets your needs instead.

### Testing build of arch=any and arch=all packages

If your package contains binary packages for `all` or `any`, you may want to test if those can be build in isolation from the full build normally done.

This verifies the Debian buildds can build your package correctly when building for other architectures that the one you uploaded in or in case a binNMU is needed or you want to do source-only uploads.

The default `pipeline-jobs.yml` does this automatically based on the contents of `debian/control`, but if you manually define the jobs to run, you also need to include the `test-build-any` and `test-build-all` jobs manually as well:

```yaml
test-build-any:
  extends: .test-build-package-any

test-build-all:
  extends: .test-build-package-all
```

`.test-build-package-any` runs `dpkg-buildpackage` with the option `--build=any` and will only build arch-specific packages.

`.test-build-package-all` does the opposite and runs `dpkg-buildpackage` with the option `--build=all` building only arch-indep packages.

### Enable generation of dbgsym packages

To reduce the size of the artifacts produced by the build jobs, auto generation
of dbgsym packages is disabled by default. This behaviour can be controlled by
the `SALSA_CI_DISABLE_BUILD_DBGSYM`. Set it to anything different than 1, 'yes'
or 'true', to generate those packages.

```yaml
variables:
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_BUILD_DBGSYM: 0
```

### Customizing Lintian

The Lintian job can be customized to ignore certain tags.

To ignore a tag, add it to the setting `SALSA_CI_LINTIAN_SUPPRESS_TAGS`.

By default the Lintian jobs fails either if a Lintian run-time error occurs or if Lintian finds a tag of the error category.

To also fail the job on findings of the category warning, set `SALSA_CI_LINTIAN_FAIL_WARNING` to 1 (or "yes" or "true").

To make Lintian shows overridden tags, set `SALSA_CI_LINTIAN_SHOW_OVERRIDES` to 1 (or "yes" or "true").

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

variables:
  SALSA_CI_LINTIAN_FAIL_WARNING: 1
  SALSA_CI_LINTIAN_SUPPRESS_TAGS: 'orig-tarball-missing-upstream-signature'
```

### Adding extra arguments to autopkgtest

Sometimes it is desirable to add arguments to autopkgtest.

You can do this by setting the arguments in the `SALSA_CI_AUTOPKGTEST_ARGS` variable.

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

variables:
  SALSA_CI_AUTOPKGTEST_ARGS: '--debug'
```

Note that autopkgtest can access the repository in the current directory, making it possible for `--setup-commands` to read commands from a file. For example:

```yaml
----
include
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

variables:
  SALSA_CI_AUTOPKGTEST_ARGS: '--setup-commands=ci/pin-django-from-backports.sh'
```

### Adding extra arguments to dpkg-buildpackage

Sometimes it is desirable to add direct options to the dpkg-buildpackage that is run for the package building.

You can do this using the `SALSA_CI_DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_ARGS` variable.

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

variables:
  SALSA_CI_DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_ARGS: --your-option
```

### Adding extra arguments to gbp-buildpackage

Sometimes it is desirable to add direct options to the `gbp buildpackage` command.

You can do this using the `SALSA_CI_GBP_BUILDPACKAGE_ARGS` variable.

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

variables:
  SALSA_CI_GBP_BUILDPACKAGE_ARGS: --your-option
```

### Executing a pre-install / post-install script in piuparts

Sometimes it is desirable to execute a pre-install or post-install scripts in piuparts.

You can do this using the `SALSA_CI_PIUPARTS_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT` and `SALSA_CI_PIUPARTS_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT` variables, that may point to the path of scripts in the project repository. This could be used, for instance, to pin dependencies. For example, if you had a `ci/pin-django-from-backports.sh` script:

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

variables:
  SALSA_CI_PIUPARTS_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT: 'ci/pin-django-from-backports.sh'
```

The `ci/pin-django-from-backports.sh`:
```shell
#!/bin/sh

set -e

# Ensure that python3-django from bullseye-backports will be
# installed as needed (bullseye has too old version)
cat >/etc/apt/preferences.d/99django-backports <<EOT
Package: python3-django
Pin: release a=bullseye-backports
Pin-Priority: 900
EOT
```

### Using automatically built apt repository
The [Aptly](https://www.aptly.info/) task runs in the publish stage and will save published apt repository files as its artifacts, so downstream CI tasks may access built binary/source packages directly through artifacts url via apt. This is currently disabled by default. To enable it, set the `SALSA_CI_DISABLE_APTLY` variable of the repository whose artifacts you want to use to anything other than `1`, '`yes`' or '`true`'. (check example below)

To specify repository signing key, export the gpg key/passphrase as CI / CD [Variables](https://salsa.debian.org/help/ci/variables/index.md) `SALSA_CI_APTLY_GPG_KEY` and `SALSA_CI_APTLY_GPG_PASSPHRASE`. Otherwise, an automatically generated one will be used.

For example, to let package `src:pkgA` of team `${TEAM}` and project `${PROJECT}` setup an aptly repository and let package `src:pkgB` use the repository, enable the `aptly` job by adding the following line to the `debian/salsa-ci.yml` of `src:pkgA`:

```yaml
variables:
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_APTLY: 0
```

The next time the pipeline of `src:pkgA` is run, a new job called `aptly` will be part of the "Publish" stage of the pipeline. Click on the job to obtain the job number which will be needed in the `debian/salsa-ci.yml` file of `src:pkgB`:

In the `debian/salsa-ci.yml` file of `src:pkgB` add the following lines after the `variables` section

```yaml
before_script:
  - echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://salsa.debian.org/${TEAM}/${PROJECT}/-/jobs/${JOB_ID}/artifacts/raw/aptly unstable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pkga.list
  - apt-get update
```

Replace `{TEAM}`, `${PROJECT}` with appropriate `team` and `project` name respectively and `${JOB_ID}` with the aptly job number of `src:pkgA` pipeline. Now you can use the binary packages produced by `src:pkgA` in `src:pkgB`. \
**Note:** When you make changes to `src:pkgA`, `src:pkgB` will continue using the old repository that the job number points to. If you want `src:pkgB` to use the updated binary packages, you have to retrieve the job number of the `aptly` job from `src:pkgA` and update the `${JOB_ID}` of `src:pkgB`.

### Debian release bump
By default, the build job will increase the release number using the +salsaci suffix.
To disable this behavior set the `SALSA_CI_DISABLE_VERSION_BUMP` to 1, 'yes' or 'true'.

### Build jobs on ARM

Salsa CI includes builds jobs for armel, armhf and arm64, but those are
disabled by default. You can enable them for your project if you have an ARM
gitlab runner available. For that, you need to register your runner, tagging it
as `arm64`, and set the related variables to anything different than 1, 'yes'
or 'true':

```yaml
variables:
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_BUILD_PACKAGE_ARMEL: 0
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_BUILD_PACKAGE_ARMHF: 0
  SALSA_CI_DISABLE_BUILD_PACKAGE_ARM64: 0
```

### Customizing reprotest

#### Running reprotest with diffoscope

Reprotest stage can be run with [diffoscope](https://try.diffoscope.org/), which is an useful tool that helps identifying reproducibility issues.
Large projects will not pass on low resources runners as the ones available right now.

To enable diffoscope, setting `SALSA_CI_REPROTEST_ENABLE_DIFFOSCOPE` to 1 (or 'yes' or 'true') is needed.

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

variables:
  SALSA_CI_REPROTEST_ENABLE_DIFFOSCOPE: 1
```

#### Adding extra arguments to reprotest

Sometimes it is desirable to disable some reprotest validations because the reproducibility issue comes inherently from the programming language being used, and not from the code being packaged. For example, some compilers embed the build path in the generated binaries.

You can get this level of customization by adding extra `reprotest` parameters in the `SALSA_CI_REPROTEST_ARGS` variable.

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

variables:
  SALSA_CI_REPROTEST_ARGS: --variations=-build_path
```

#### Breaking up the reprotest job into the different variations

By default, reprotest applies all the known variations (`--variations=+all`,
see the full list at
[reprotest(1)](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/reprotest/reprotest.1.en.html)).
One way to debug a failing reprotest job and find out what variations are
producing unreproducibility issues is to run the variations independently.

If you want to run multiple reprotest jobs, one for each variation, set the
`SALSA_CI_ENABLE_ATOMIC_REPROTEST` variable to 1, 'yes' or 'true':

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/salsa-ci.yml
  - https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/raw/master/pipeline-jobs.yml

variables:
  SALSA_CI_ENABLE_ATOMIC_REPROTEST: 1
```

You can also set the `SALSA_CI_ENABLE_ATOMIC_REPROTEST` variable when
triggering the pipeline, without the need of creating a specific commit.

#### Faketime is currently disabled

Note that reprotest's faketime support is currently disabled, as it causes false
positives on files touched by quilt. It will be re-enabled once this is fixed.
https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/-/issues/251

## Hacking

To contribute, forking the project and opening a merge request should be straight forward.

Things to take into consideration:

1. The branch name is used as a staging tag on the generated images.
Because of this, slashes (`/`) are not allowed, otherwise CI will fail.
Avoid branch names like `something/other`.

1. Your fork should have 'Public' visibility for the pipeline to be shown on the merge request.

1. Please sign your commits. Debian relies on OpenPGP to guarantee the
authenticity and integrity of contributions.

1. YAML files follow a two-space indentation. Scripts in other languages should
follow their language-wide coding style.

### Allow images to be persistent

By default all images are deleted when the pipeline is finished. This is to avoid images
being created and stored in the registry when the project is forked.

To disable this behavior set the `SALSA_CI_PERSIST_IMAGES` to 1, 'yes' or
'true' on a CI variable (*CI/CD Settings*).
